   * no continuity in the assignment can be assumed. Slice generations are used when serializing and
   * deserializing assignments (see [[Assignment.fromDiff()]] for more information), for
   * debugging, and to provide a conservative indication of how long a key has been assigned to the
   * same SQUID ("conservative" for reasons illustrated below). Consider the result of committing a
   * proposal at generation 50:
   *
   * {{{
   * predecessor @47: | pod1 @42 | pod1 @47        | pod2 @42 | pod3 @42 | pod4 @47            |
   * sliceMap:        | pod1     | {pod1,pod2}     | pod2                | pod3     | pod4     |
   * result @50:      | pod1 @42 | {pod1,pod2} @50 | pod2 @50            | pod3 @50 | pod4 @50 |
   * }}}
   *
   * Notice that in the result,
   * - The first Slice has kept its previous generation @42, as the first Slice is newly assigned
   *   with exactly its previous resource and without Slice boundaries change.
   * - The second Slice is assigned with a different set of resources, so it has a new generation.
   * - Although part of the third Slice and the entire last Slice have been stably assigned to the
   *   same resource, their Slice boundaries has changed so they are having new generations.
   *
   * We only carry forward Slice generations when the set of assigned resources and load
   * measurements are unchanged, or within some threshold in the case of load measurements.
   * Assignment continuity is captured with finer granularity in
   * [[SliceAssignment.subsliceAnnotationsByResource]].
   *
   * The [[SubsliceAnnotation]]s in [[SliceAssignment.subsliceAnnotationsByResource]] will also fill
   * in the `stateTransferOpt` field when appropriate, to indicate the previous resource that
   * can be used to fetch state for a Subslice. Note that as a current limitation,
   * `stateTransferOpt` will not be filled in if there are multiple source replicas to choose from.
   * If it is false, then the newly generated assignment will clear all `stateTransferOpt`, so that
   * state transfer basically gets disabled.
   *
   * TODO(<internal bug>): Create state transfer information even when there are multiple source replicas
   *                  to choose from.
   *
   * The `primaryRateLoadThreshold` parameter controls the threshold above which a new
   * [[SliceAssignment]] will be created for a Slice, even if the proposed assignment is
   * identical modulo [[SliceAssignment.primaryRateLoadOpt]]. (See the remarks on
   * [[SliceAssignment]] to understand why we do not require an exact match between the
   * previous and current load measurements. Note that when the previous Slice is in the "loose"
   * generation incarnation, any change in load is considered above threshold, as there is no
   * opportunity to optimize assignment sync by using assignment diffs in that case.) The threshold
   * is a change ratio relative to:
   *
   *    `abs(primaryRateLoad - previous.primaryRateLoad) / previous.primaryRateLoad`
   *
   * If `previous.primaryRateLoad` is zero, then a transition to non-zero is considered a change,
   * which is how we avoid a divide-by-zero error.
   *
   * Consider the following example of a previous Slice assignment, with primary rate load 10:
   *
   *    `SliceAssignment([a .. b), gen42, pod-0, ..., primaryRateLoad = 10.0)`
   *
   * Assuming a 10% (0.1) threshold, a [[ProposedSliceAssignment]] with the same Slice
   * and resource would be carried forward unchanged iff. its `primaryRateLoad` is in the range
   * [9.0, 11.0]:
   *
   *  * `ProposedSliceAssignment([a .. b), pod-0, primaryRateLoad = 9.0)` appears as
   *    `SliceAssignment([a .. b), gen42, pod-0, ..., primaryRateLoad = 10.0)` in the committed
   *    assignment. In this case, the new load (9.0) is within the threshold (10.0 +/- 10%), so
   *    the committed `SliceAssignment` has the same generation as the predecessor, and the primary
   *    rate load is not changed (10.0 is "close enough" based on the threshold).
   *  * `ProposedSliceAssignment([a .. b), pod-0, primaryRateLoad = 12.0)` appears as
   *    `SliceAssignment([a .. b), gen47, pod-0, ..., primaryRateLoad = 12.0)` in the committed
   *    assignment. In this case, the new load (12.0) is outside of the threshold (10.0 +/- 10%), so
   *    the committed `SliceAssignment` has a new generation, and the primary rate load is changed.

      //    providers, which are less preferred because they might be unhealthy or overloaded. (An
      //    extra reason is that state providers without slice ownership tend to drop application
      //    state quickly after serving the first acquiring request, but this is a higher level
      //    StateMigrator detail and is subject to change in the future.)
      // 2. After choosing a set of state provider candidates, we sort the provider candidates and
      //    the proposed resources by their internal ordering, and use this order to generate the
      //    transfer schedule by assigning state provider candidates to newly assigned resources
      //    (state acquirers) in a round-robin manner. This is a sub-optimal but simple and

      //    providers to support the most basic state transfer functionality for asymmetric key
      //    replication.

      // For example:
      //
      // Previous resources:  pod0  pod1  pod2  pod3
      // Proposed resources:              pod2  pod3  pod4  pod5  pod6  pod7  pod8
