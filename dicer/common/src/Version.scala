  // Used to report the version of the code that the client is running. Allows us to figure out when
  // changes are rolled out and get a sense for when we can make backwards-incompatible changes on
  // the server. Do note it is possible that the client service ends up rolling back some time
  // later, so we should always leave a sufficient buffer of time. The version number represents
  // seconds since the epoch (`date +%s`) on the creation date.
  //
  // Version changelog
  //
  // 1761600610 (2025-10-27):
  // - Added support for receiving serialized assignments from the server in the watch requests.
  //   Clients with this version or later will indicate the support through
  //   `supports_serialized_assignment` to the server in their watch requests, enabling the server
  //   to respond with serialized assignment.
  //
  // 1712123631 (2024-04-02):
  // - Added generalized support for syncing token maps in the client rather than individual tokens.
  //   This allows arbitrary sets of versioned values to be synced between assigners via clients.
  //
  // 1711357000 (2024-03-25):
  // - Changed ContinuousAssignments to allow less than or equal generation number as the
  //   SliceAssignment (previously it was just less than). This will be used for state transfer.
  //
  // 1710541787 (2024-03-15):
  // - Eliminate usage of hazzers for redirect protos so that even the empty proto results in the
  //   desired redirect being sent. See https://github.com/databricks-eng/universe/pull/522450.
  //   (As of that PR, the Assigner server never sends a non-empty redirect proto, so even older
  //   clients will still do the right thing as long as the Assigner server is sufficiently up to
  //   date.)
  //
  // 1702512000 (2023-12-14):
  // - First version that we track.
  // - Has support for handling redirects sent by the server.
