 * REQUIRES: `value` is non-negative.

 * Incarnations form the upper-64 bits of the 128-bit Generation. The storage layer only increases
 * the lower-64 bits of the Generation when creating new versioned objects, which then makes it
 * possible to create greater Generations than ever before by simply increasing the Incarnation.
 *
 * An incarnation number encodes whether or not the set of all versioned objects within
 * that incarnation form a linear history and whether certain application-specific optimizations or
 * strong semantics are supported (see [[isNonLoose]] for definition). Incarnations encoding these
 * strong semantics for their versioned objects are called "non-loose" incarnations, and otherwise
 * are called "loose" incarnations.
 *
 * Non-durable stores which are unable to reliably track object incarnations should choose a fixed
 * number (and odd, to form a "loose" incarnation, see [[isNonLoose]]) for all chosen object
 * incarnations. Durable stores, on the other hand, are expected (but not required) to utilize
 * non-loose incarnations and provide linear histories of their versioned objects.

  /**
   * There are two types of Incarnations, called "loose" and "non-loose". When "loose" and
   * "non-loose" are used in the context of generations, the terms mean that the generation's
   * incarnation is loose or non-loose.
   *
   * Non-loose generations are used by durable stores and guarantee linear (non-divergent) histories
   * of their versioned objects. That is, if an object has generations g1 and g2, g1.incarnation ==
   * g2.incarnation, and g1 < g2, then the object at generation g2 is guaranteed to have been
   * created causally after the object at generation g1. Non-loose generations are also used by
   * individual stores to express or implement support for certain optimizations or even additional
   * semantic guarantees on their versioned objects which are application specific. For example,
   * assignments in non-loose incarnations support diffs in order to efficiently sync assignment
   * state among system components, and additionally make strong guarantees about continuous
   * assignment of slices. See [[SliceAssignment]] for details.
   *
   *   Note: Since https://github.com/databricks-eng/universe/pull/465640, linear histories are
   *   technically guaranteed as long as g1.incarnation.storeIncarnation ==
   *   g2.incarnation.storeIncarnation, however to maintain backwards compatibility with existing
   *   client code, the definitions of loose and non-loose on [[Incarnation]]s as a whole were
   *   preserved. If needed, the concepts of loose and non-loose could be changed to apply
   *   specifically to the store incarnation, however since incarnations still represent distinct
   *   lifetimes of a versioned object in the store (and therefore object specific "non-loose"
   *   features like assignment diffing and continuous assignment guarantees do not apply across
   *   incarnations), there exists no present need to change this.
   *
   * Loose generations are used by non-durable stores and do not have the above guarantee. That is,
   * for a given object, the set of all generations within the same loose incarnation may form a
   * divergent history. For example, an object in a loose incarnation may have generation numbers
   * 8, 9, and 10, but 10 may have been generated causally after 8 but in parallel with 9, and so
   * not be aware of 9's existence. There may even be multiple versions with generation number 9. In
   * general, anything is possible.
   *
   * "Non-loose" is encoded as a positive even value. Otherwise, the incarnation is "loose". This
   * interleaving of loose and non-loose incarnations allows us to always be able to move "ahead" in
   * the versioning space to either loose or non-loose incarnations as needed (e.g. if a durable
   * store went kaput and we needed to move ahead to a non-durable store in an emergency).

/**
 * REQUIRES: number is non-negative
 *
 * The generation is used as a version number. It has two parts to it - an [[Incarnation]] and a
 * generation number. One should think of this as a 128-bit integer with the incarnation number
 * comprising the most significant bits. The incarnation number is present to allow generations to
 * be monotonically increasing across multiple incarnations of the versioned object within and
 * across storage layers (see [[Incarnation]]).
 *
 * In general a (durable) store can simply achieve monotonicity using a simple per-object 64-bit
 * generation number that is advanced on every update in the store (expected to track time in
 * milliseconds since the Unix epoch to serve as a debugging aid, subject to monotonicity
 * constraints). To maintain monotonicity in the case that objects can potentially be deleted and
 * re-created (e.g. due to garbage collecting unused objects), the store can additionally maintain a
 * high watermark for used versions and require that writes for new keys propose versions greater
 * than this watermark.
 *
 * No matter how a particular storage layer decides to achieve monotonicity for generations, to
 * maintain monotonicity across whole storage layer changes (e.g. due to loss or corruption), the
 * store incarnation must be bumped (see [[Incarnation]]), making all future generations chosen by
 * the Assigner to be strictly greater than all previous generations. Bumping the store incarnation
 * is expected to be an extremely rare occurrence.
 *
 * Note that the above discussion applies to durable stores which are able to guarantee
 * monotonicity. Non-durable stores in general do not have such versioning guarantees, and
 * monotonicity is best-effort. Whether guaranteed monotonicity is supported (and perhaps other
 * strong semantics that are specific to the type of versioned object) is encoded in the
 * [[Incarnation]]. See [[Incarnation]] for details.
