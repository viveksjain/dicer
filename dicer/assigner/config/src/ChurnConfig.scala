/**
 * The churn config defines a [[maxPenaltyRatio]] that is applied to the load of a resource when it
 * is reassigned to a new Slice. By making keys more expensive to reassign, the churn penalty
 * discourages constant refinements (and potential oscillations) of the assignment. For example, a
 * given Slice is less likely to bounce between resources if there are small changes in relative
 * load over time, because small improvements in load balancing are offset by the overhead imposed
 * by the penalty.
 *
 * @param maxPenaltyRatio Churn penalty ratio that is applied when a Slice is reassigned.
