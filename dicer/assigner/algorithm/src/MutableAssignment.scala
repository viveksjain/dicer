/**
 * A mutable assignment of Slices to resources. It supports the following operations efficiently:
 *
 *  - Get the least and most loaded resources.
 *  - Get the list of Slices assigned to a resource.
 *  - Allocate/deallocate a resource to/from a Slice.
 *
 * Any resource that is in `baseAssignmentSliceMap` but not `resources.availableResources` is
 * considered unhealthy and returned by [[getUnhealthyResourceStates]], and unhealthy resources are
 * never returned by [[resourceStatesIteratorFromColdest]]. Resources in
 * `resources.availableResources` but not
 * `assignment` are considered healthy, just with 0 slice replicas assigned to them initially (thus
 * they will be the coldest resources).
 *
 * Note that this mutable assignment abstraction is only used as a helper of [[Algorithm]],
 * providing efficient methods for the Algorithm to conveniently represent, inspect and manipulate
 * the assignment. Its interfaces are closely coupled with Algorithm's implementation and is not
 * meant to be used elsewhere.
 *
 * @param instant ignored but kept for interface compatibility with internal code.
 * @param baseAssignmentSliceMap the slice map of the base assignment that is used to initialize the
 *                               current assignment.
 * @param resources the set of available resources.
 * @param adjustedLoadMap load information to use for load balancing. May include adjustments to
 *                        actual recent load measurements to account for (say) estimated future
