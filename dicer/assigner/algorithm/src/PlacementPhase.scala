      //    slice is newly assigned to a resource, and this is summed over all slices. See
      //    `ChurnConfig` for more details.
      //  - undershoot_penalty is for a resource being below the minimum desired load, to encourage
      //    better load balancing. It is calculated as the sum of
      //    `(1 + (min_desired_load - resource_load) / min_desired_load) ^ 2 *
      //       (min_desired_load - resource_load) * 4.0` for each resource that is below the minimum
      //    desired load. The coefficient of 4.0 is higher than the churn penalty ratio, so that we
      //    are willing to move some amount of load to avoid undershoot. The quadratic term adds a
      //    multiplier varying between 1.0 and 4.0 as the undershoot increases.
      //  - overshoot_penalty is for a resource being above the maximum desired load, to encourage
      //    better load balancing. It is calculated as the sum of
      //    `(resource_load / max_desired_load) ^ 2 * (resource_load - max_desired_load) * 16.0` for
      //    each resource that is above the maximum desired load. The coefficient of 16.0 is higher
      //    than the undershoot penalty, since overshoot can lead to server overload and is more
      //    risky. The quadratic term adds a multiplier starting from 1.0, increasing as the
      //    overshoot increases.
      //  - empty_resource_penalty is for any empty resource, so that we prioritize filling them
      //    (since this phase guarantees that every resource ends up non-empty). We set it to a very
      //    high value of `max_desired_load * 100` (for each empty resource) so that it dominates
      //    other penalties and there will be a slice that can be reassigned or replicated to the
      //    empty resource to reduce the penalty.
      //  - replication_penalty is the penalty for the additional replicas in the assignment, to
      //    encourage having fewer replicas unless needed to balance load. The cost of adding
      //    another replica is the `slice_per_replica_load` before the replication, i.e. the total
      //    penalty of a slice with `i` replicas is
      //    `replication_penalty(i) = sum_i total_slice_load / i` which is
      //    `total_slice_load * (1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/(i-1))`. Note that upreplicating also
      //    imposes churn cost in addition to the replication penalty.
      //
      // As an example, suppose that a resource is 10 load under the min desired load of 1000, and
      // the smallest slice that can be reassigned to it has load 100. Then, the churn penalty of
      // that slice is 100 * 0.25 = 25 (based on the default churn penalty ratio). But the
      // undershoot penalty will be 1.01^2 * 10 * 4 = 40.8, so the solver will prefer to reassign
      // the slice to avoid undershoot. However, if the resource was instead only 1 load under the
      // min desired load, the solver would not reassign a slice with 100 load to it.
      //
      // The coefficients for these different penalties have been set somewhat arbitrarily based on
      // what seems reasonable, and likely could use more tuning.
