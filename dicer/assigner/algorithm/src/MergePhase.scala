    /**
     * A candidate is a pair of adjacent slices that may be merged. While the [[Merger]] is running,
     * it repeatedly finds the pair of adjacent slices with the lowest total load and merges them.
     * To motivate the data structures used in this implementation, consider the assignment with the
     * following Slices and corresponding load values:
     *
     *     ["","b")->10.0, ["b","c")->5.0, ["c","d")->5.0, ["d",∞)->10.0
     *
     * In this example, there are three candidates for merging: we can choose to merge at "b", "c",
     * or "d". Each [[CandidateSlicePair]] is an [[IntrusiveMinHeapElement]] instance in which the
     * priority is the total load of the adjacent slices, which allows us to efficiently find the
     * best candidate (with the lowest total load) at each step in an [[IntrusiveMinHeap]], and to
     * update the priorities of candidates as their neighbors are merged. The min-heap for the
     * example above contains:
     *
     *     Candidate(left=["b","c")->5.0, right=["c","d")->5.0), priority=10.0)
     *     Candidate(left=["","b")->10.0, right=["b","c")->5.0), priority=15.0)
     *     Candidate(left=["c","d")->5.0, right=["d",∞)->10.0), priority=15.0)
     *
     * The heap is intrusive because after merging a particular candidate, the expected total load
     * for the surrounding candidates is also modified. For example, if we merge at "c" (since the
     * corresponding candidate has the lowest total load), then the heap becomes:
     *
     *    Candidate(left=["","b")->10.0, right=["b","d")->10.0), priority=20.0)
     *    Candidate(left=["b","d")->10.0, right=["d",∞)->10.0), priority=20.0)
     *
     * The original candidate is removed from the heap, and the two surrounding candidates are
     * updated to reflect the new (potentially) affected Slices and the new total load. In addition,
     * we maintain `successorOpt` and `predecessorOpt` links for each candidate so that we can
     * efficiently find the candidates that need to be fixed up after a merge.
