/**
 * REQUIRES: Each [[TestResourceAssignment]] has the same size of
 *           [[TestResourceAssignment.interestingSliceReplicas]].
 * REQUIRES: The [[TestSliceReplica.Assigned]] at the same index in each
 *           [[TestResourceAssignment.interestingSliceReplicas]] should have the same load value.
 *           For example:
 *           {{{
 *             MigrationTestAssignment(
 *               "pod0" --> Seq(35.0, 30.0),
 *               "pod1" --> Seq(35.0, ----),
 *               "pod2" --> Seq(----, ----)
 *             )
 *           }}}
 *           is a legal representation, while
 *           {{{
 *             MigrationTestAssignment(
 *               "pod0" --> Seq(35.0, 30.0),
 *               "pod1" --> Seq(36.0, ----),
 *               "pod2" --> Seq(----, ----)
 *             )
 *           }}}
 *           is an illegal one, because the first slice has 2 replicas with different loads 35.0
 *           and 36.0.
 * REQUIRES: The load of each interesting slice replica should be greater than 1.0.
 *
 * Simplified representation of an assignment used in migration phase tests that supports conversion
 * to real assignments (see [[assignment]]) and assertion of compatability with real assignments
 * (see [[assertHasSameInterestingSlicesAndTotalLoadsAs]]) for test verification purpose:
 *
 *  - The specific Slice boundaries are not relevant to the migration phase, so this class only
 *    represents the loads and continuously assigned ages (see [[TestSliceReplica]]) of the slice
 *    replicas assigned to each resource in [[resourceAssignments]]. The slices are distinguished
 *    from each other by their indices in [[TestResourceAssignment.interestingSliceReplicas]]. For
 *    example, in
 *    {{{
 *      MigrationTestAssignment(
 *        "pod0" --> Seq(35.0, 30.0),
 *        "pod1" --> Seq(35.0, ----),
 *        "pod2" --> Seq(----, ----)
 *      )
 *    }}}
 *    The first interesting slice contains 2 replicas with 35.0 load each assigned on pod0 and pod1,
 *    and the second interesting slice contains 1 replica with 30.0 load assigned on pod0. Note that
 *    pod2 is assigned neither the first nor the second aforementioned slices, and will be assigned
 *    only "placeholder" slices (see below).
 *  - Other than the [[TestResourceAssignment.interestingSliceReplicas]], the
 *    MigrationTestAssignment automatically creates the "placeholder" slices in the generated real
 *    assignments, either to satisfy the requirements of [[TestResourceAssignment.extraLoad]], or to
 *    make the slices fill up the whole slice space.
 *  IMPORTANT note:
 *  - While [[MigrationTestAssignment]] is designed to simplify the construction of migration phase
 *    tests, it does not completely eliminate the need to choose slice and resource load values in
 *    such a way that avoids interference from the policy phase of the algorithm. For example,
 *    although [[MigrationTestAssignment]] will create single-key slices for each of the interesting
 *    slices to avoid the possibility of splits in the policy phase, these interesting slices are
 *    still susceptible to replication or de-replication if their load is too high or too low. Also,
 *    if the interesting slices have relatively little load compared to the total load on the
 *    resources, then it is possible that the placeholder slices could end up being hotter than the
 *    interesting slices, causing the migration phase to consider them instead of the interesting
 *    slices for migration. Users should call [[assertHasSameInterestingSlicesAndTotalLoadsAs]] to
 *    check that the final result is as expected.
