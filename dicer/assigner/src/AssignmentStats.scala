        // The total churn for this slice will be computed by summing up the amount of
        // load that didn't move and taking the difference with the total load on the slice.
        //
        // The total churn is classified into three types:
        // * Removal churn: Load that had to move because a resource was removed.
        // * Addition churn: Load that moved to "load up" a new resource.
        // * Load balancing churn: Load that moved between resources due to load balancing.
        //
        // Classification can be tricky because for a given unit of new load showing up on a
        // resource, it's sometimes up to us to make a call about how to classify it.
        //
        // For example, consider if a slice was assigned to r1 and r2 in the old assignment (but
        // not assigned to r3), each with load 50, and r1 was removed in the new assignment, and
        // the slice was assigned to r2, r3, and r4 in the new assignment (where only r4 is a new
        // resource):
        //
        // old asn: r1: 50, r2: 50, r3: 0
        // new asn:         r2: 33, r3: 33, r4: 33
        //
        // In this example, 33 units of load didn't move (on r2), yielding a total churn of
        // 100 - 33 = 67 which we can classify in different ways according to different approaches:
        //
        // * Approach 1: Account as much as possible to removal (r1), then the rest to addition
        //   (r4):
        //   * Removal churn: 50, addition churn: 17, load balancing churn: 00
        // * Approach 2: Account as much as possible to addition (r4), then the rest to removal
        //   (r1):
        //   * Removal churn: 34, addition churn: 33, load balancing churn: 00
        // * Approach 3: Consider 17 units to be load balancing from r2 to r3, then account the
        //   rest to removal (r1):
        //   * Removal churn: 50, addition churn: 00, load balancing churn: 17
        // * Approach 4: Consider 17 units to be load balancing from r2 to r3, then to addition
        //   (r4), and then the rest to removal (r1):
        //   * Removal churn: 17, addition churn: 33, load balancing churn: 17
        //
        // So, to eliminate ambiguity and make the definitions of removal, addition, and load
        // balancing churn well defined, we follow this basic rule when classifying churn:
        //
        // ** Prefer to attribute as much load as possible to removal churn, then addition churn,
        // ** and finally load balancing churn.
        //
        // The reasoning for this is because removal churn is churn that we absolutely cannot
        // avoid. By attributing as much churn as we can to removal churn, we're accurately
        // reflecting in this metric the amount of churn that was strictly unavoidable by Dicer.
        // We then attribute as much as possible to addition churn, since when there is a new
        // resource, the primary reason for moving the load is to fill up the new resource, and
        // not load balancing. Finally, load balancing churn is all the load we moved that wasn't
        // because we had to (removal) and wasn't because we were filling up a new pod (addition).
