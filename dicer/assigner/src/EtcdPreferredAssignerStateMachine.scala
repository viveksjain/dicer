/**
 * REQUIRES: `storeIncarnation` is non-loose, see [[Incarnation.isNonLoose]].
 *
 * The preferred assigner state machine, used to help make assignment generation highly available.
 * For full details, see <internal link>.
 *
 * To improve on the availability of our earlier single pod assigner, the preferred assigner design
 * uses a set of assigner replicas, each of which can each potentially generate assignments.
 *
 * For operational simplicity, the design attempts to make it very likely that only a single
 * assigner, the preferred assigner, is generating assignments at any given time. This is
 * accomplished by having an etcd store which acts as the source of truth about the identity of the
 * preferred assigner, and by propagating knowledge of the preferred assigner via store watchers and
 * heartbeats between assigners.
 *
 * Only an assigner which believes itself to be the preferred assigner (typically exactly one) will
 * actually generate and write assignments. If another assigner transiently and incorrectly believes
 * it is the preferred assigner due to network partitions or other issues, no serious harm results
 * because of the OCC checks that prevent interleaved writes to the assignment store.
 *
 * The other assigners act as standby assigners and monitor the health of the preferred assigner via
 * heartbeats. If a standby finds that the preferred assigner is from a past store incarnation, or
 * that is unhealthy, or if there is no preferred assigner, it will attempt to become the preferred
 * assigner by writing its identity to the preferred assigner store with an OCC check.
 *
 * This state machine update its knowledge of the preferred assigner via events from by the driver,
 * which watches the preferred assigner store and receives heartbeat requests from other assigners.
 * Heartbeat requests include the requester's latest knowledge of the preferred assigner. The driver
 * likewise responds to heartbeats with its latest knowledge of the preferred assigner. In this way
 * news typically spreads quickly regarding changes to the preferred assigner.
 *
 * The state machine tracks the current preferred assigner and determines when some other assigner
 * is preferred and it should act as standby. As standby, it sends periodic heartbeats to that
 * preferred assigner to monitor its health. A heartbeat is considered to have failed if its
 * response does not arrive before the next heartbeat is due to be sent. If too many heartbeats fail
 * consecutively, the state machine attempts to make its assigner preferred by writing its identity
 * to the store. (Note that an assigner can therefore lose its preferred status by responding too
 * slowly or not at all.) The state machine retries the write as needed if the current preferred
 * assigner remains unhealthy and this or some other assigner does not become preferred.
 *
 * If there is no preferred assigner, the state machine likewise writes its identity to the store to
 * become preferred, retrying as needed.
 *
 * The driver may also deliver a pending termination event to indicate that the assigner is
 * scheduled to be shutdown. In this case, and this assigner is acting as preferred, the state
 * machine will attempt to abdicate by writing "None" to the preferred assigner store so that some
 * other assigner will take over.
 *
 * @param selfAssignerInfo the identifying information for this assigner.
 * @param storeIncarnation Store incarnation for preferred assigners understood by the state
 *                         machine (the state machine operates entirely in the scope of a single
 *                         store incarnation, and is unable to observe any state outside this
 *                         store incarnation).
