/**
 * REQUIRES: `storeIncarnation` is loose.

 * In-memory store that maintains known assignments and supports "writing" assignments (where the
 * store assigns generations with [[Incarnation.isLoose]] incarnations). These assignments are
 * ephemeral, and an assignment may be lost forever if the Assigner hosting the in-memory store
 * crashes before distributing it to Clerks and Slicelets, or if all Clerks and Slicelets that are
 * aware of the assignment crash before syncing it with the Assigner. The Assigner learns about
 * assignments written by other Assigner processes via a sync protocol, and those assignments are
 * passed to [[informAssignment]] for this store.
 *
 * The store operates entirely within the scope of the configured `storeIncarnation`. That is, it
 * is only capable of choosing generations in this store incarnation, and is only capable of caching
 * assignments that it learns about from this store incarnation.
 *
 * TODO(<internal bug>): Support caching assignments from future store incarnations to make store
 * incarnation changes less disruptive.
