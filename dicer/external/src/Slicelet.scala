/**
 * A handle represents an in-progress operation where the Slicelet wants to track ownership of a
 * key. It can call [[isAssignedContinuously]] before externalizing any results. [[close]] must be
 * called once the operation is complete (e.g. at the end of the RPC handler). It is recommended to
 * use [[scala.util.Using]] for this (you might need to add a bazel dep on
 * "{parent}/org.scala-lang.modules/scala-collection-compat_{scala}").
 *
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   Using.resource(slicelet.createHandle(key)) { handle: SliceKeyHandle =>
 *     if (handle.isAssignedContinuously) {
 *       processRequest(handle, req)
 *     } else {

 *       throw DatabricksServiceException(ErrorCode.INTERNAL_ERROR,
 *         s"$key does not seem to be owned by this pod")

 *   def processRequest(handle: SliceKeyHandle, req: Request): Unit = {
 *     val state = readFromDb()
 *     ...
 *     if (handle.isAssignedContinuously) {
 *       writeToDb(newState)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * If the operation is asynchronous and returns [[scala.concurrent.Future]], use
 * [[scala.concurrent.Future.andThen]] to close the handle at the end of the operation, taking care
 * to also handle any exceptions created by synchronous code:
 * {{{
 *   val handle: SliceKeyHandle = slicelet.createHandle(key)
 *   try {
 *     if (handle.isAssignedContinuously) {
 *       processRequest(handle, req)
 *         .andThen { case _ => handle.close() }
 *     } else {
 *       // Create appropriate exception.
 *       throw DatabricksServiceException(ErrorCode.INTERNAL_ERROR,
 *         s"$key does not seem to be owned by this pod")
 *     }
 *   } catch {
 *     case t: Throwable =>
 *       // Handle exceptions from else case or thrown directly (i.e. synchronously) by
 *       // processRequest.
 *       handle.close()
