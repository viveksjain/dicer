/**
 * The class that allows a caller to route requests to the right resource (e.g., pod) in the same
 * cluster as the caller.
 *
 * Cross-cluster routing is _not_ supported via this API as of May 2025. Please reach out to
 * the maintainers if you have a cross-cluster use case.
 *
 * If a Clerk is being used for forwarding (e.g., an RPC is first sent to a random pod, which
 * then sends it to an assigned peer pod in the same service), there is a risk of forwarding loops,
 * e.g., where two servers believe the other is assigned a particular key and ping pong a
 * request. To avoid this, we recommend using a separate logical RPC for the initial unaffinitized
 * request and the subsequent affinitized request. Note that forwarding in general should be avoided
 * when possible: https://sre.google/sre-book/addressing-cascading-failures/. Instead, consider
 * proxying, redirects, etc...
 *
 * The Clerk is thread-safe, and all calls on the Clerk are synchronous and non-blocking.

   *
   * For a given [[Target]], this class allows the caller to determine the Stub for
   * the resource(s) that are handling a particular [[SliceKey]].
   *
   * For generality, Dicer maps the slice key to a [[ResourceAddress]], then calls an
   * application-defined stub factory to map the address to an application-specific Stub type.
   *
   * The stub is typically an RPC stub, but can be any type, even just the raw resource address
   * if the application needs total control.
   *
   * Dicer caches stubs to avoid creating a stub on every request.
   *
   * The clerk will not immediately be ready to route as network communication is needed to obtain
   * the initial resource mapping. Applications may observe completion of the [[Clerk.ready]] future
   * to learn when the Clerk has received an initial resource assignment.
   *
   * The mapping of SliceKeys to resources is updated asynchronously, so there is no guarantee that
   * the Slicelet to which a request is routed by the Clerk will still own the key when it receives
   * that request. As a result, the application should check for ownership/affinity on the Slicelet
   * side using the Slicelet's API when handling a request.
   *
   * @param sliceletHostName This is the domain name address of the Slicelet service that serves
   *                         assignments, usually backed by clusterIP.
