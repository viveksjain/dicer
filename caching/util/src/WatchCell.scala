/**
 * This abstraction provides the notion of a "cell", a single value of type T that can be watched
 * by one or more subscribers. A single producer (or a coordinated set of producers) produce values
 * and the value is sent to the subscribers. If the watch cell is provided with an error, this
 * error is propagated to the subscribers and all subscribers are unsubscribed from the cell.
 * After this point no more values or errors can be provided to the cell. Subscribers watch the cell
 * using the `watch` call and terminate their watching using the `cancel` call. The producer
 * provides values using [[setValue]] and an error using [[setErrorStatus]]. At any point, the
 * caller can check the latest value (even after an error) using [[getLatestValueOpt]] or the final
 * error status using [[getStatus]]. This abstraction is thread-safe.
