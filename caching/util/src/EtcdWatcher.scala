/**
 * State machine driver for an [[EtcdClient.watch]] request. Implements [[Cancellable]] so that the
 * watch can be interrupted. Note that cancellation has no effect until after an initial read has
 * been performed.
 *
 * The driver includes two features to mitigate the risk of a wedged watch, which is known issue
 * with the etcd client that we use:
 *
 * - Backup polling: The driver periodically performs a tail read at the most recently known
 *   version, so that even if the underlying watch is wedged the application continues to receive
 *   watch events.
 * - Bounded watch lifetime: The driver automatically cancels the watch after a specified duration
 *   so that the caller will create a new (and hopefully healthy) watch.
 *
 *  Both of these features are configurable via the [[Config]] object passed to the constructor.
 *
 * @param sec The sequential execution context used to protect watcher state.
 * @param jetcd The client used to reach the etcd cluster.
 * @param keyNamespace The namespace of the key being watched.
 * @param watchArgs The arguments to the watch request.
 * @param callbackOpt The callback to which watch events are supplied. When None, the watch has
 *                    received a terminal error.
