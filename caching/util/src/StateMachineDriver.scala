/**
 * A driver that collaborates with a [[StateMachine]] to manage a combination of state and
 * asynchronous activity. See <internal link> for details and code samples.
 *
 * The code follows an active-passive pattern where the driver is active but simple, while the state
 * machine is passive but "decisive", in the sense of deciding actions the driver should take
 * after each event based on the current state. Factoring the logic in this fashion makes the
 * interesting state machine logic simpler, more obviously correct, and easier to evolve.
 *
 * The active driver is responsible for delivering events of type [[EventT]] to the state machine.
 * In response, the state machine updates its state and returns a sequence of actions of type
 * [[ActionT]] for the driver to perform. It also returns the next time at which the state machine
 * should be called with an "advance" event, assuming no other events are handled in the interim.
 *
 * The core [[StateMachineDriver]] implementation is responsible for invoking the state machine at
 * the appropriate times, requiring only a `performAction` handler from concrete implementations.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY DISCIPLINE
 *
 * In contrast with most thread-safe components in the Caching team code base, the driver requires
 * that all public methods are called from within the configured concurrency domain (usually an
 * SEC) rather than scheduling itself to run asynchronously within the domain. This is because our
 * intention is for the driver object to be owned by some higher-level component (`class FooDriver`
 * in the example above) whose state is in the same concurrency domain as the driver instance.
 *
 * A consequence of this unopinionated concurrency discipline is that performance sensitive
 * code can use a StateMachineDriver with a [[HybridConcurrencyDomain]] and call into the driver
 * synchronously, enabling calls into the state machine without the overhead of transferring
 * control to another thread.
 *
 * @param domain the concurrency domain within which the driver runs and protects all driver state.
 * @param stateMachine the passive state machine implementation.
 * @param performAction the handler function responsible for initiating actions requested by the
 *                      state machine. Called in `domain`.
 * @tparam EventT the type of event handled by the state machine, typically a sealed trait so that
 *                possible event types can be exhaustively handled in a `match` block.
 * @tparam ActionT the type of action performed by the driver, typically a sealed trait so that
 *                 possible actions can be exhaustively handled in a `match` block.
 * @tparam MachineT the type of the state machine, which must extend
 *                  `StateMachine[EventT, ActionT]`.
 *
 * The caller MUST call [[start]] before calling any of the other methods in this class.
