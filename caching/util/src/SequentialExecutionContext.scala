/**
 * This type provides an abstraction of a thread of execution such that each piece of work run or
 * scheduled on it is executed sequentially one at a time, i.e., not concurrently. These execution
 * contexts are supposed to be used as part of a cooperative task management paradigm where each
 * context guards some coarse-grained piece of state. One can think of these contexts as
 * "coarse-grained" locks with a nice property that one does have to explicitly acquire or release
 * locks. However, it is the responsibility of each work item to not use the execution context for a
 * "long time" or block the execution context (since the remaining items will simply wait for such
 * long/blocking work items to finish).
 *
 * ORDERING
 *
 * The context is a FIFO abstraction. Commands added to the context with zero delay -- e.g. via
 * `execute`, `run`, or `call` -- will run in the order they are added. An ordering guarantee
 * applies not only to such "immediate" commands, but to all commands with non-negative delays:
 *
 *     A is added with delay X before B is added with delay Y, and X <= Y ==> A runs before B
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   // a() runs before b()
 *   sec.run { a() }
 *   sec.run { b() }
 *
 *   // c() runs before d()
 *   sec.schedule("c", 10.seconds, c)
 *   sec.schedule("d", 10.seconds, d)
 *
 *   // e() runs before f()
 *   sec.run { e() }
 *   sec.schedule("f", Duration.Zero, f)
 *
 *   // g() runs before h()
 *   sec.schedule("g", Duration.Zero, g)
 *   sec.run { h() }
 *
 *   // i() runs before j()
 *   sec.schedule("i", 2.seconds, i)
 *   sec.schedule("j", 3.seconds, j)
 *
 *   // k() runs before l()
 *   sec.run { k() }
 *   sec.schedule("l", 1.nanosecond, l)
 *
 *   // Ordering of m and n is non-deterministic (how much delay between calls?)
 *   sec.schedule("m", 1.nanosecond, m)
 *   sec.run { n() }
 * }}}
 *
 * Internally, the `WorkItemQueue` data structure provides this guarantee.
 *
 * FAIRNESS
 *
 * A common failure mode in executor implementations is starvation of scheduled commands when the
 * queue is backlogged with immediate commands. This can have serious consequences. Consider for
 * example what happens when scheduled background garbage collection is deprioritized because a
 * system is heavily loaded: accumulation of garbage makes all work more expensive, which
 * exacerbates the work backlog, and you have a cascade failure. This context implements a simple
 * policy to prevent this failure: when a command is added, either for immediate execution or with
 * some delay, its "desired execution time" is recorded (basically, "now" plus some non-negative
 * delay), and commands are executed in order of their desired execution time. When two commands
 * have the same desired execution time, the command that was added first runs first. The effect of
 * this policy is that all commands, whether scheduled or immediate, experience the same delay
 * relative to their desired execution time based on the current backlog in the context.
 *
 * Internally, the `WorkItemQueue` data structure implements this policy.
 *
 * CANCELLATION
 *
 * The execution context supports cancellation of scheduled commands even though futures in Scala do
 * not directly support it. (Commands introduced for "immediate" execution cannot be cancelled.)
 * This implementation avoids two pitfalls of cancellation implementations:
 *
 *  - Cancelling does not require a scan of all scheduled commands. (We have seen implementations
 *    that scan the schedule heap to find cancelled commands to remove; internally, our
 *    implementation relies on [[IntrusiveMinHeap]] which has O(log(n)) removal of elements.)
 *  - Cancelled commands do not occupy any memory. (We have seen implementations that leave stub
 *    entries in the schedule heap that get cleared only when the cancelled command would have run
 *    if not cancelled. This becomes prohibitively expensive in cancellation-heavy workloads, e.g.
 *    request hedging.)
 *
 * For additional background on the concurrency patterns encouraged and supported by this
 * abstraction, see <internal link>.

     * INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION SECTION
     *
     * Locking discipline, see <internal link> for details:
     *
     *  - Private methods must only be called while holding `lock` (a single [[ReentrantLock]]
     *    protects all internal state for the context).
     *  - Corollary: all public methods and callbacks should immediately acquire the `lock`.
     *  - The lock must not be held while executing commands supplied to the context.
     *
     * High-level strategy:
     *
     *  - The context keeps track of all pending commands in [[WorkItemQueue]], which is responsible
     *    for ordering guarantees and implementing the fairness policy.
     *  - Commands are executed in the [[tickle]] method, which is in turn executed on the
     *    underlying `pool`. Every time it is tickled, the context checks for pending work, executes
     *    the next command if any, and then makes sure the context will be tickled again when the
     *    next command is due to run by calling [[ensureScheduled]].
     *  - When a command is added to the context (via `schedule`, `execute`, `run`, etc.), it is
     *    added to the [[WorkItemQueue]]. Then [[ensureScheduled]] is called to make sure that
     *    `tickle` will be called at the appropriate time if the added command is the next one due
     *    to run.
     *  - In general, [[ensureScheduled]] tries to maintain at most a single outstanding `tickle`
     *    call on the underlying `pool` at a time, by (for example) cancelling any pending scheduled
     *    pool task before scheduling a new one. But cancellation is best-effort, so we need to
     *    account for spurious tickle calls (where no new work is discovered).
     *  - We can't use just `lock` to ensure sequential execution, as the lock must be released when
     *    calling a user-supplied command (see "locking discipline"). As a result, the executor
     *    keeps track of whether it's in the `PENDING` or `RUNNING` state. If [[tickle]] or
     *    [[ensureScheduled]] is called while the context is in the `RUNNING` state, they do
     *    nothing, relying on the `RUNNING` thread to advance the context as needed when the current
     *    command runs.
     *
     * Notable constraints:
     *
     *  - The implementation assumes that the `pool` will not execute commands synchronously on the
     *    calling thread. We would need to revisit our locking discipline were that to change.
     *  - Beyond releasing `lock` while running commands, locks are "maximally" acquired for the
     *    duration of all public methods and callbacks. Optimize with care! See notes on programming
     *    with locks in <internal link>.
