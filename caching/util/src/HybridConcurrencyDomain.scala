/**
 * A concurrency control abstraction which serializes concurrent access to a shared resource.
 * "Hybrid" refers to the fact that both asynchronous tasks and synchronous tasks can be scheduled
 * and serialized within the domain. For a fully cooperative, sequential domain, use
 * [[SequentialExecutionContext]] instead.
 *
 * Synchronous execution is performed via [[executeSync()]] (see warnings on using this method in
 * its spec), while asynchronous execution is done by scheduling `Pipeline` transformations on the
 * domain. All the asynchronous tasks are guaranteed to be executed in the order they are scheduled.
 *
 * Support for [[StateMachineDriver]] will be implemented in a future PR.
 *
 * Synchronous execution examples:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val domain: HybridConcurrencyDomain = ...
 *
 *   def func(): T = ...
 *
 *   // `func` is executed here in the calling thread, and `result` will be of type T.
 *   val result: T = domain.executeSync {
 *     func()
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * Asynchronous execution examples:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val domain: HybridConcurrencyDomain = ...
 *
 *   // `func` is scheduled asynchronously in `domain`.
 *   Pipeline {
 *     func()
 *   }(domain).toFuture
 *
 *   // `func2` is scheduled asynchronously in `domain` after func1, which runs inline.
 *   Pipeline {
 *     func1()
 *   }(InlinePipelineExecutor)
 *   .map {
 *     func2()
 *   }(domain)
 * }}}
