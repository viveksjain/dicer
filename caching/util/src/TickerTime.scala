/**
 * A typed class that provides nano second precision along with relational, and saturation
 * arithmetic operators. Used to represent the time in nanoseconds since the beginning of some
 * fixed, arbitrary, origin time. The origin time is different in every process. The origin time may
 * be in the future, so [[nanos]] may be a negative value. See [[System.nanoTime()]] for additional
 * background.
 *
 * Saturation arithmetic: if an operator logically results in a value greater than `MAX`, returns
 * `MAX` rather than overflowing, and if an operator results in a value less than `MIN`, returns
 * `MIN` rather than underflowing (a.k.a. negative overflowing).
 *
 * @param nanos The number of nanoseconds since the origin time.
