 * Because of the need to maintain locations, this abstraction is "intrusive", i.e., it requires

 * [[IntrusiveMinHeapElement]] base class. Additional complications relative to a basic heap:
 *
 *  - If an element is contained in a heap, it cannot be pushed again (either onto the same heap
 *    or a different heap) unless it is first removed or popped, since only a single location is
 *    maintained for each element.
 *  - Elements must be refs, not values, since the implementation relies on reference stability.
 *
 * Not thread-safe. External synchronization is required when modifying the heap, either directly
 * via [[push]] and [[pop]] or indirectly via [[IntrusiveMinHeapElement.setPriority]] and
 * [[IntrusiveMinHeapElement.remove]].
