# Contributing to Dicer

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Dicer. We welcome external contributions, but because Dicer is a production-critical system at Databricks, we follow a structured contribution process. Please read this document before starting any work.

## Start With an Issue

Before writing code, open a GitHub issue describing the change you would like to make. This applies to all contributions, including features, bug fixes, refactors, and documentation.  

If you intend to contribute code, state that clearly in the issue. Please do not begin significant work until the issue has been discussed and acknowledged by a maintainer.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement. After you open an issue and indicate your intent to contribute, a maintainer will contact you with instructions for completing the CLA. Pull requests will not be reviewed until the CLA is completed.

## Scope and Alignment

Dicer is a critical infrastructure system at Databricks. The open source repository is generated from our internal codebase using automated tooling such as Copybara.  

As a result:

* Contributions must be relevant to real internal use cases  
* We may decline changes that are not aligned with our internal architecture or roadmap  
* Correctness, stability, and operability take precedence over new features

When in doubt, please open an issue and ask before proposing a change.

## Pull Requests

Once an issue is approved and the CLA is complete, you may submit a pull request.  

Pull requests should:

* Address the approved issue only  
* Follow existing code style and conventions  
* Include tests or validation
* Use clear, descriptive commit messages

Maintainers may request revisions or additional context during review.

## Communication

Be respectful and constructive in all interactions. Use GitHub issues for questions, proposals, and discussion.

## License

By contributing to Dicer, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project’s license.
